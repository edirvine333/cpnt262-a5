## NOTES  

1. I used the .js and .ejs extensions, even though they are not required, as I want to be able to recognize later on that they are files, not standard arguments being passed.  
2. Using semi-colons for client-side Javascript and no semi-colons for server-side Javascript.
3. No CSS used, as the focus of this assignment is Javascript using fetch() and routing modules.
